In _Introduction to Manifolds_, did it say a real-analytic function is
equal to its Taylor series? Wikipedia says it means *locally* equal to
its Taylor series on some neighborhood of every point, which seems
different. (I'm not sure it is different, but I think it is.)

However, it agrees that "real analytic" is a stronger property than
"smooth".
